... CLOSED TASKS ....

* Handle blank values a bit more intelligently (all blanks -> nil)
  * Add support for INSERTs, UPDATEs and DELETEs (of table-data)
* Deal w/ NULL values
* Deal w/ BOOL values
* Build out MVP for PostgreSQL loader
  * Create temporary table from table-metadata and load all of the parsed rows
    into it (build create, update and delete logic atop the temporary table)
  * Map [object-]types to database types (in the loader?)
* Add windowing to pulls (simulate w/ 2 different data-files if necessary)
  * Store max-timestamp pulled (NULL or previous window + window size)
  * Add configuration to `Table` for window-size (in the future this can scale
    dynamically)
* Include [window] timestamps in query-string for pull[er]
* Figure out an intelligent way to solve the chicken <-> egg problem for
  `table_metadata`
* Fail fast if there are no candidate tables (`next_table`)
* Ensure that the puller does not try to go into the future (`next_window`)
* Add in a primitive logging facility (can be temporary)
* Enhance `next_table_sql`
* Lock tables (feeds) during pull, parse and load
* Verify table-locking mechanism behaves as expected
* Ability to drop a table
* Reorder args: "table, table_name" to: "table_name, table"
* Reorder args: "table, index_name, *columns" to "index_name, table, *columns"
* Ability to create an index
* Ability to drop an index
* Indices on `created_at` and `updated_at` columns
* Gracefully handle table {,un}locking in case of error
* Add debugging code
* Raise no-window & no-table exceptions (making them catchable upstream)
* Minimize race-condition around table-locking (use where on UPDATE, raise if
  zero rows are updated)
* Log number of delete, inserts and updates in `loader`
* `load_temporary_table` should bomb if there is data outside the window
* Delete from outside window where id in temporary table
* Rename `data` to `rows` in `execute`
* Rename `Postgres` to `PostgreSQL`
* Finish PostgreSQL support (requires `pg` gem)
* Add MySQL support (requires `mysql2` gem)

... MVP TASKS ...

* Usage/configuration examples in README.md

... ONGOING TASKS ...

* Add tests
* Add comments where appropriate
* DRY/Refactor

... OPEN TASKS ....

* Build out change-log tables
* Build out canonical, fact and aggregate tables (and related transforms)
* Configurable re-pull window (do this automatically once up to current?)
* Add schema management capabilities (detect schema-deltas and suggestion
  modifications)

... DEFERRED TASKS ...

* Fix JRuby bundle/build

... CLOSED QUESTIONS ...

* Where is the best place to create the connection?
  * Immediately? Then it's open during the pull, etc.
  * Lazily? Makes for connection logic all over the place
    * Perhaps it can be centralized entirely into the `Database` class?
* Consider using ISO-8601 timestamps in query-string (not sure on this one, it
  is slightly more fragile because of URL-encoding, etc.)

... INTEGRATION CONSIDERATIONS ...

* Deployment
* Scheduling (Daemon? CRON?)
